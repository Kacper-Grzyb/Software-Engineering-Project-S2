\section{Conclusion}

In conclusion, the LinkedGym project has provided a valuable learning experience and the knowledge that the lectures helped us gather have here been put in practice. The insights gained and skills developed during this project will most certainly be beneficial in our future.

The project's primary objective was to create a unified, user-friendly platform that streamlines communication, custom plan creation, progress tracking, and overall coaching experience for both fitness coaches and trainees. In our opinion we successfully worked out the outline and skeleton of the project, preparing everything to start the code developing phase, in the form of sprints.

Throughout the project, we encountered and overcame various challenges, for example using software we never used before for design, and for other various tasks or putting ourselves in the mind of our customers. Our design process, involving user personas, journey maps, wireframes, and prototypes, was crucial in making sure we found exactly what we all were looking to develop.

The business model development showed a viable opportunity for LinkedGym, with potential revenue streams from transactional commissions and partnerships with sporting brands. However, the success of LinkedGym will depend on effective marketing and the ability to attract influencers and coaches to the platform.

As this was our first project implemented in the proper Software Development way, there are several areas for potential improvement and future development, but in the teams opinion all of these improvements would be naturally addressed if we actually used Scrum's iterative process. There weren't any huge gaps in our progress and work, that a first iteration should not have. The things mentioned in the Evaluation are problems that would be addressed at the Sprint Review, and fixed in the coming Sprints. 

Overall, this project has been an invaluable learning experience, providing insights into the complexities of software development and project management. It has equipped us with practical skills and knowledge that will be beneficial in our future careers in software engineering. We hope that LinkedGym really has the potential to make a significant impact in the online fitness coaching industry.
