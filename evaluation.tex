Working on the LinkedGym application has been a real challenge, which, we believe, has armed us with many necessary skills for software development processes and project management. In this evaluation we aim to assess various aspects of the project, from the achievement of objectives to the performance of the team and the methodologies employed.

\subsection{Project Objectives and Goals Evaluation}
The objective of LinkedGym was to create a platform that elevates the online coaching experience by baking the communication services, custom plan creation, and progress tracking all into one convenient and intuitive application. This objective in our opinion can be met, according to the research, the succes of the prototyping and the other exercises we completed as part of the course. The app successfully addresses and solves the problem we identified with the user experience in current online coaching apps, providing a more cohesive and user-friendly interface.

\subsection{Project Management and Processes}
The project was planned to be managed using the Scrum framework, which will in theory will be effective given the iterative and flexible nature of the development process. If the development were to get under way, the team would adhere to regular sprint cycles, continuously improving and adaptating to the changing requirements.

\subsection{Team Performance}
The team demonstrated strong collaboration and communication throughout the project. Each member contributed to almost every aspect of the project, from initial brainstorming, design and diagrams to the business canvas. The use of clear, to the point communication has helped us quickly resolve any issue that came up. This clear communication allowed us to help each other understand and grasp the ideas taught in the lectures.

\subsection{Lessons Learned}
We have learned an incredible amount about the development process of a Software Project. The eachxercises were done throught the course, each one done the same week as it was teached and not left for the last week, which helped to understand and implment the techniques thought in class.

\subsection{Overall Success and Areas for Improvement}
Overall, the LinkedGym project can be deemed a success, having met its primary objectives, which was to learn and practice. However, there are areas for improvement, the obvious being user testing, since the one for this project did not get much nor usefull feedback initially. Another area which we could focus more on is the market research, this can may be achieved by different questionnaries of people involved in this topic.
